# Operating-Systems-Project

This is a university project, that has been assigned to me.

The request was for a multithreaded client-server application, to manage an address book.
Where only certain users can modify or read the database, and others can only read it.

The database is based on a dynamic array data structure, ordered by key.
And it's capable of O(log n) reads, and O(n) writes.
